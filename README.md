# Zahidi - Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi - Im Zahidi, this repo is a collection of hands-on SOC and Offensive project i build to learn and show real skills.

## About my work 
I build reproducible, small scale SOC and penetration test labs to practice Blue Team including detection engineering, adversary emulation, and incident triage. focusing on clear evidence such as documented steps, sanitized logs.

Current level: Junior / early-career. I have hands-on lab experience and familiarity with SIEM queries, Sigma rules, and basic triage workflows. I dont claim production SOC ownership or live pentest operation. I will always work within agreed sxope and safe environtment.

## Focus
- SOC: Incident triage, SIEM dashboard, Detection engineering, Sigma rules.
- Pentest: Adversary labs emualtion, PoC writeups.

## Top Projects
1. **30-Day SOC challenge** - dayli triage example, splunk queries, incident reports.
2. **Detections Repos** - Sigma rules, splunk queries, test case.
3. **Adversary Lab Emulation** - stepwise pentest scenario with MITRE mapping and mitigation.
